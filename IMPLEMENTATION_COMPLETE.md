## 💡 How It Works

### Simple Flow
```
1. Customer adds product to cart
2. Customer checks out
3. System finds shopkeeper with stock
4. Randomly selects one shopkeeper
5. Creates order linked to shopkeeper
6. Reduces shopkeeper's stock
7. Shopkeeper sees order in dashboard
```

### Technical Flow
```python
# In account/views.py - OrderView.post()

for item in cart_items:
    # Find shopkeepers with stock
    shopkeeper_products = ShopkeeperProduct.objects.filter(
        product=item.product,
        stock_quantity__gte=item.quantity
    )
    
    if shopkeeper_products.exists():
        # Random selection
        shopkeeper_product = random.choice(list(shopkeeper_products))
        shopkeeper = shopkeeper_product.shopkeeper
        
        # Reduce stock
        shopkeeper_product.stock_quantity -= item.quantity
        shopkeeper_product.save()
    
    # Create order item
    OrderItem.objects.create(
        order=order,
        product=item.product,
        shopkeeper=shopkeeper,  # NEW!
        quantity=item.quantity,
        price=item.product.price
    )
```

---

## 📊 Database Changes

### New Field
```python
# OrderItem model
shopkeeper = ForeignKey(
    'shopkeeper.Shopkeeper',
    on_delete=SET_NULL,
    null=True,
    blank=True,
    related_name='order_items'
)
```

### Existing Models Used
- `Shopkeeper` - Already existed
- `ShopkeeperProduct` - Already existed with stock tracking
- `Product` - No changes needed
- `Order` - No changes needed

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
```
GET /api/shopkeeper/customer-orders/
```

### Updated Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/orders/
# Now assigns shopkeeper and reduces stock
```

### Existing Endpoints (No Changes)
```
POST /api/shopkeeper/login/
GET /api/shopkeeper/dashboard/
GET /api/shopkeeper/products/
GET /api/shopkeeper/inventory/
```

---

## 💰 Commission System

**Platform Commission:** 15%
**Shopkeeper Earnings:** 85%

Example:
```
Product Price: $100
Platform Gets: $15
Shopkeeper Gets: $85
```

Calculated in dashboard:
```python
commission_rate = 0.15
total_commission = total_revenue * commission_rate
net_earnings = total_revenue - total_commission
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test
```bash
# 1. Setup
Scripts\setup_shopkeepers.bat

# 2. Login as shopkeeper
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/shopkeeper/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"shop_electronics","password":"shopkeeper123"}'

# 3. View dashboard
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/shopkeeper/dashboard/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# 4. Place order as customer (use existing flow)

# 5. Check shopkeeper sees order
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/shopkeeper/customer-orders/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {shopkeeper_token}"
```

### Full Testing
See `SHOPKEEPER_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` for comprehensive testing guide.

## 🔐 Security

✅ **Authentication**
- JWT tokens for shopkeepers
- Separate login endpoint
- HttpOnly cookies

✅ **Authorization**
- Shopkeepers have `is_staff=True`
- Can only access own data
- Cannot access other shopkeepers' data

✅ **Data Validation**
- Stock validation before order
- Atomic stock reduction
- No negative stock allowed

✅ **Commission**
- Calculated server-side
- Cannot be manipulated by shopkeeper
- Transparent tracking

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Stock Management
- Stock is automatically reduced when order is placed
- If no shopkeeper has stock, order item created without shopkeeper
- Shopkeepers can update stock via API

### Random Selection
- If multiple shopkeepers have stock, one is randomly selected
- Future: Can be enhanced with location-based selection

### Commission
- Fixed at 15% (hardcoded)
- Future: Can be made configurable per shopkeeper

### Verification
- Shopkeepers have `is_verified` field
- Currently set to True by default
- Future: Can implement verification workflow

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Location-based shopkeeper selection
- [ ] Shopkeeper ratings & reviews
- [ ] Bulk product upload
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Payout management system
- [ ] Email notifications for shopkeepers
- [ ] Multi-warehouse support
- [ ] Configurable commission rates
- [ ] Shopkeeper verification workflow
- [ ] Customer can choose shopkeeper

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Random Selection:** Not based on location or rating
2. **No Partial Fulfillment:** Order must be fulfilled by one shopkeeper
3. **Fixed Commission:** 15% for all shopkeepers
4. **Manual Verification:** Admin must verify shopkeepers manually
5. **No Notifications:** Shopkeepers not notified of new orders (yet)

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Shopkeeper can't login**
- Check `is_staff=True`
- Verify password is `shopkeeper123`
- Ensure shopkeeper exists in database

**Stock not reducing**
- Check migration applied: `python manage.py showmigrations`
- Verify ShopkeeperProduct exists
- Check stock_quantity >= order quantity

**Orders not showing**
- Verify OrderItem has shopkeeper assigned
- Check shopkeeper is authenticated
- Ensure order was placed after implementation

### Get Help
1. Check documentation files
2. Review `SHOPKEEPER_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
3. Run `python manage.py shell` to inspect database
4. Check Django logs for errors
